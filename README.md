# 🐱 FocusLink – Stay Productive or Get Judged by a Cat

## 📱 What is this?

FocusLink is an Android app that helps you *actually* stay focused.  
Instead of doom-scrolling Instagram, YouTube, or Twitter, FocusLink pops up and goes:  

> “Nope. Not today. Enjoy this motivational video instead.”  

And if you still try to cheat? **The cat will silently judge you.** 🐈👀

## ✨ Features

* 🔒 **Redirect Distractions**  
  Try opening a social media app → you get instantly redirected to a motivational video.  

* ⏰ **Scheduled Focus Lock**  
  Set a focus window (e.g., 9 AM – 5 PM). During this time you *cannot* disable FocusLink.  
  (Yes, I made it so even I can’t cheat. Don’t test me.)  

* 🎥 **Custom or Built-in Videos**  
  Upload your own motivational video, OR use the pre-bundled one if you’re too lazy.  

* 🔁 **Endless Loop Mode**  
  Videos repeat until you *actually* get back to work.  
  Because one pep-talk is never enough.  

* 🛡 **Accessibility Service Magic**  
  Uses Android’s Accessibility Service to detect foreground apps and block them instantly.  

* 🎨 **Minimalist UI**  
  Clean Material3 design, gradient backgrounds, custom switches, and of course — cat vibes.

## 🐾 Why Is It Safe?

This app is 100% safe. Why?  

* Because I can’t even hack my own Wi-Fi password — hacking your data is impossible. 🤷‍♂️  
* No shady permissions. Only **Accessibility** (to block apps) + **Video playback**.  
* The only one “spying” on you is your cat. 🐈  

So relax — **your focus is safe with me (and the cat).**

## 🚀 Tech Stack

## 😼 Future Plans

* Add **gamification** → earn points for focus streaks.  
* Add **Angry Grandma Mode** 👵 for extra motivation if cats don’t work.  
* Cloud sync (maybe). If I ever learn how not to break my own router.
