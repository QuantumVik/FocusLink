# FocusLink
Here’s a **ready-to-paste GitHub README description** for your app repo, written both informative + funny 😼:

# 🐱 FocusLink – Stay Productive or Get Judged by a Cat

## 📱 What is this?

FocusLink is an Android app that helps you *actually* stay focused.
Instead of doom-scrolling on Instagram, YouTube, or Twitter, FocusLink jumps in and says:

> “Nope, you’re watching a motivation video instead.”

And yes, if you try to cheat, **the cat will silently judge you.**

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔒 **Redirect Distractions**
  Try to open social media? Boom → you get redirected to a motivation video.

* ⏰ **Scheduled Focus Lock**
  Set a focus window (e.g., 9 AM – 5 PM). During this time, you can’t disable FocusLink.
  (Seriously. I coded it so even *I* can’t cheat. Don’t test me.)

* 🎥 **Custom or Built-in Video**
  Upload your own motivation video, OR use the pre-bundled one if you’re lazy.

* 🔁 **Endless Loop**
  Videos play on repeat until you get back to work. Because one pep-talk is never enough.

* 🛡 **Accessibility Service Magic**
  Uses Android’s Accessibility Service to detect foreground apps and block them.

* 🎨 **Minimalist UI**
  Clean Material3 design, with gradient background, custom switches, and a judgmental cat vibe.

## 🐾 Why Safe?

This app is 100% safe. Why?

* Because I can’t even hack my own Wi-Fi password, forget hacking your data. 🤷‍♂️
* No shady permissions. Just Accessibility + Video playback.
* Your cat’s judgment is the only surveillance here. 🐈

So don’t worry—**your focus is safe with me (and the cat).**

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* Kotlin/Java (Android)
* Accessibility Service API
* ExoPlayer for video playback
* SharedPreferences for persistence
* Material3 UI components

---

## 😼 Future Plans

* Add gamification (earn points for each focus streak).
* Replace “judgmental cat” with “angry grandma mode” for extra motivation.
* Cloud sync? Maybe. (But again, can’t hack, so… we’ll see.)

# TL;DR

FocusLink = Block apps → Play motivation → Get judged by a cat → Stay productive.

👉 Do you also want me to write a **funny GitHub repo tagline** (the one-liner shown *under* the repo name) like:

> *“Stop scrolling. Start focusing. Or get judged by a cat.”* ?
